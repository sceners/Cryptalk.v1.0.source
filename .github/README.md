Date of completion of the program: April 8, 2006

Description:

A program for network communication between several computers. Both the server and the client are contained in one program file, but they are independent. This means that we can simultaneously have the server running on our own computer, and be connected to the server on another computer and chat on the other computer. The server supports up to 50 connected clients. All clients connected to a given server talk in 1 chat, i.e. peer-to-peer. All transmission between the server and connected clients is encrypted.

Directions for use:

To create a server, press the Create server button. To connect to the server, enter its IP address in the Connect to field and your nickname in the mynick text field. Creating a server on your own computer does not mean that you can talk on it right away. We must first connect to it, i.e. in this case we connect to ourselves (the server and the client are independent). After connecting to the server, a list of users currently connected to the server appears on the right. We send messages to the server by entering them into the text field on the left side of the mynick field and pressing enter or the Send button.
